shortly after thanksgiving in 1987 an intruder broke into the Tucker residents in Arlington, Virginia.
it might have been just another statistic but the crime committed that night launched a new era in police investigations.
this is how DNA evidence and psychological profiling helped catch a serial killer and set an innocent man free.
this.
everything about twenty ten to twenty soft spoken.
amazing.
softness about.
this call is a forty four year old sins and Tucker was a publication's editor who worked for the United States forestry service she was spending the thanksgiving holiday alone since her husband Reggie was out of the country in Wales on a business trip neither of us could put the phone down.
we kept saying I love you.
he said this over and over again.
how many times but without explanation telephone calls went unanswered.
and neighbors noticed her bedroom window wide open in the cold November weather so they called police.
as they approached the front door he noticed it was a job.
inside a woman's purse was lying on the for your floor I arranged a call in the Monday.
and again.
can.
I don't know anything.
Susan talkers badly decomposed body was lying face down on the bed.
she had been dead for five days.
and we're tied behind their back feet were tied the head hanging over the side of the bed almost she had been strangled and possibly raped it appeared that the killer more than likely was was inside the home for some quite some time I mean it wasn't I just very you know quick in and out type of a situation you know many of the the door was open you know ransacked had been gone through when Reggie Tucker first heard the news he was devastated.
bad news.
and I knew it.
my.
following.
texted Joe forecasts of the Arlington police homicide unit was quickly assigned to the case his task wouldn't be easy for one thing the killer had been careful worn gloves and left no fingerprints the White Plains it had been raining on the night of the murders and he meticulously clean the area around his point of entry he's smart enough to know that.
footprints which is what we were we would have gotten from that would maybe come back to haunt him which kind of tells you maybe some past experience on burglaries police collected the sheets nightgown and a large sleeping bag which conferences in Tucker's body to look for possible blood and semen stains they found hairs on the betting around Susan Tucker's body in the bathroom sink and on a wash cloth discovered outside on the clothes line and they gathered shards of broken glass from the basement window.
everything was taken to the forensics lab for analysis but perhaps the most important clue was also the most obvious the ropes and knots used to strangle Simpson talked to police were convinced they had seen this killers work before.
three years earlier a thirty four year old lawyer named Caroline Hann had been raped and strangled in her home only four blocks away from Susan Tucker the killer entered the harm residents the same way.
basement window.
he tied his victim using the same not and it's not a common occurrence not not common at all to save victims killed by using ligatures to strangle them of ropes tying up victims that's it's really quite rare but the harm case was closed when this man David Vasquez confessed to her murder and was sentenced to thirty five years in prison could he have had an accomplice I'm sure you're harga spoke to him for several hours and from the way he was talking and everything and answer my questions I didn't think he knew a damn thing about Caroline Holmes murder while detective Hargis began his search for Susan talkers Keller one hundred miles away in the capital city of Richmond police there were investigating a series of murders shockingly similar the body of thirty five year old Debbie Davis was found inside her south Richmond apartment and raped and strangled in less than a month two young women have been raped and strangled in their homes just a few blocks from each other in each case.
Austin tray with the murder ending back cutting green.
entering through an open window each victim was crying both victims were white green ages.
thirty five years two weeks later he struck again this time the fifteen year old girl raped and strangled in her bedroom but her family was sleeping all three have been bound raped and strangled with a rope the knots were identical to the ones used in the Arlington cases detected harga suspected that the killer of Susan talk.
was the same man who murdered Caroline Harmon and the three women in Richmond.
if this is correct.
the serial murderer was loose.
on a one hundred mile killing spree.
detective worn this believe the man who raped and strangled Susan Tucker and also murdered Caroline from three years earlier.
Argus also believe the same man was responsible for the three rapes and murders in Richmond one hundred miles away the Richmond police weren't so sure I mean they have three murders that were within a couple miles square radius size I'm guessing or or maybe even less.
%HESITATION that you know and and now we're trying to say that a hundred miles away we're trying to link something to their.
I can't get out of here I missed all the local guy.
Horace was a man of it was the perfect man for this case because he was obsessed he he was he knew something was wrong author Paul Monet has wrote a bestselling book entitled stalking justice it profiles the rapes and murders of these five women and the history making investigation which followed Joe Hargis is motivated by the by the the hunt he's not a guy who's obsessed by issues of right and wrong except for his own internal moral compass which tells of his innocent man in prison I don't care if we got the guilty guy we got to get the innocent man out and he was determined to get this guy in part this was right the all of these murders were connected he needed proof for that he turned to the forensics lab where scientists were examining the stains found on Susan talkers night gown and Betty I found for semen stains and when I analyze sleeping bag I found one very large Siemens day I typed all of those stains the semen came from an individual with type O. blood and the PGM one enzyme profile although this match thirteen percent of the population it also makes the scene and found that the Caroline Homer to see.
next they turned their attention to the hair found at the Tucker crime scene and there are characteristics microscopic light that can classify hair into one of three racial categories which are location negroid or mongoloid the hairs found at the Tucker crime scene appeared to be pubic and did not appear to be from the victim or her husband they were positively identified as negroid in our region this was another possible link to the Caroline Humm murder case three years earlier at the time of harm's murder a black male wearing a mask had raped a number of women in the same neighborhood the masked rapist was never apprehended and Hargis always suspected that there was a connection to the harm murder actually the same day the Caroline Holmes body was found another girl lady was in her house and.
this black male with a mask and a knife burglarized her plight house caught her and actually he did some sexual activity with her the Richmond police and later at the Arlington police ball sought help from the F. B. I.'s behavioral science unit in Quantico Virginia this unit has interviewed hundreds of serial killers to learn what similarities exist in their psychological makeup they were able to predict a number of important things about the killer we get a look at the the behavior that's that's left behind the offender in the commission of his crime it's we believe that by looking at.
%HESITATION.
that behavior we can interpret of the type of offender that may have committed the crime.
strangler attacked his victims in their homes suggested that he stalked them first and knew precisely when to strike the FBI concluded that the perpetrator was between the age of eighteen and thirty.
the quiet time alone.
held in menial jobs.
he probably had a troubled relationship with his mother and began his crime spree with arson starkly many serial rapists and murderers begin with ours.
serial killers are usually white but could be and he lived to work close to where he committed his first crime.
that's because criminals are beginning their crimes please enter the area where they feel most comfortable.
he took sadistic pleasure in strangling his victims he would periodically released the bindings so we could hear his victim pleads for her life it appeared that the perpetrator had intended the victim to suffer.
considerably in one case a shoe impression was found on the victim's back these what women wear obviously first just terrified to the very bone and then were systematically sexually assaulted and you know at the end and it's not clear whether they were dead when he did this for a live body also masturbated on his victims and it was these semen samples which would prove to be extremely important pieces of evidence I can remember a prosecutor Helen Fahey couple days after the murder asking me if this is going to be a a DNA case and I'm kind of I don't know what we don't even know what we've got yet in nineteen eighty seven when Susan Tucker was murdered DNA evidence was still in its infancy the first time D. N. A. evidence was used in a criminal case was only a year earlier in England when DNA from a semen sample was used to convict a bakery worker with the rape and murder of two fifteen year old girls August decided to try this new DNA testing sending the semen stains from Suzanne Tucker's night down to the life coach laboratory in New York forensic scientists were concerned that the samples may have degraded or been contaminated you basically isolate the DNA you cut it up you generate profiles are patterns and you then generate these patterns on a piece of x-ray film so it's like a picture of the DNA and when you then compare these pictures and the components are the same the two delays that would indicate that the from the same source the final results from the DNA tests would take up to ten weeks but detectives for this still didn't have the suspect.
detectives are just suspected that the same individual who raped and murdered Susan Tucker and Caroline Hann three years earlier was the masked rapist who was committing crimes in the same area but was never caught so Hargis drove out to an area of Arlington known as green valley.
the area where the masked rapist committed his first assaults the FBI told Hargis that rapist usually commit their first prime close to home.
if the first rape was the first rate for this guy that he would have lived around there and it was very crucial to me because I didn't I didn't know that and as he drove through green valley Hargis tried to recall the names or faces of likely suspects young man he'd run across over the years who came from that area and it just so happens to detect August's started to focus on this one juvenile he he had dealt with the remember me just couldn't place the name and all I could remember was Tammy I could see his face.
I remembered the approximate.
time period everything that he.
and I remember him from but I could remember his last name to run all these names to the computer saying when they've been locked up and released and suddenly he just came in and said Spencer Timothy Spencer that's the name and I saw where he was arrested in on the January the twenty ninth nineteen eighty four which was four days after Callum harm her body was found.
benchers history on the phone.
in trouble as a teenager he had a string of burglary convictions and even more surprising just as the F. B. I. predicted.
penser had first drawn police attention for arson for setting fire to his mother's car he was presently in a halfway house in Richmond.
that.
that's exciting now Spencer was on probation living in this halfway house just a short distance from where the Richmond murders took place and according to house records Spencer had been signed out during the thanksgiving holiday visiting his mother in Arlington the week Susan Tucker was murdered the fact that he got out of prison two weeks before the first murder down in Richmond.
the fact that he was available for every murder the fact that he came to Arlington when he did for our murder and the FBI was correct about another important detail Spencer lived in the area where the first rape was committed and that happened over there and at the time Timothy Spencer was living down here over this hill in his mother's house barely a mile from the homes of Caroline Hann.
on January twentieth nineteen eighty eight police arrested Timothy Spencer.
than ours they had collected the blood sample some of his hair and confiscated his clothing for forensic analysis the clothing was scraped down for removing any debris and once that debris was collected it was taken to a microscope several dozen particles of glass were removed from the debris that was removed from his clothing the glass Frank.
%HESITATION of particular interest to the police.
after police recovered glass particles from Spencer's clothing they were examined forensically to see if they matched glass from any of the victims homes one technique is called glass refraction analysis by shining light from different points on the spectrum through the particles the characteristics of the glass can be plotted on a graph in effect measuring how the particles bands light if you stick the pin into the water which is more dense than the air it bends the light.
what we're doing with the glass particle basically is measuring how much the light is bent in a refracting we call it refractive index they compared the glass fragments found on Spencer's clothing to the glass particles taken from the broken window with Susan Tucker's home we were able to say that that glass that was removed from Spencer's clothing either came from that particular pain or that particular source of glass or another source of glass that had the same optical characteristics when scientists completed the DNA analysis of the semen stains found at the Susan Parker crime scene they made a chilling discovery and I remember point out an x-ray film from the from the developer and holy enough from these two separate cases and being bombarded immediately that the Patterson senior the same I'm seeing the same profile on this case from one county versus case from second county which says to me that same the same persons involved in both of those incidents will give you chills up and down your spine to see something like that Argus was right all along the semen sample from the individual who raped and presumably murdered Susan talker matched the semen stains from the murders in Richmond there were seven hairs they were consistent with his there was a glass fragment that was consistent with his family can provide him with a complete alibi for the entire weekend and finally Timothy Spencer's blood DNA was compared to the semen samples from the crime victims was within a sample from Mr Spencer to test we generate a profile that was the same as the profile we got from the evidence for samples with a frequency of occurrence of greater than one in a million so that means only one person in a million the population would have that particular genetic profile and starting with the first result the blood type.
it was a match it was a match it was a match it was a match on July eleventh nineteen eighty eight.
Timothy Spencer went on trial for his life it was the first time in the United States where DNA evidence would be used in a serial murder case it took the jury less than seven hours to find Timothy Spencer guilty of rape and capital murder he was sentenced to death.
some kind of relief.
%HESITATION.
but another of my wife back.
that's that's really the bottom line is.
I never really feel happier account feel happy about somebody.
being guilty.
of raping and murdering my wife I can feel happy about that.
so whatever and I feel.
I will feel.
was pronounced mother tending position at eleven thirteen PM there were no complications Mr Spencer did not make a last statement thank you up until his death I don't think.
the Timothy Spencer made the connection between semen and blood.
I don't think he knew that the same DNA this in your statement is in your blood without the in a it would have been impossible to convict Timothy Spencer.
he would if he had committed those murders a year or two years earlier he could not have been convicted in fact if this had been nineteen eighty four or nineteen eighty five.
we probably would not even have arrested him some people ask the question will DNA fingerprinting replace detective work I don't think so Susan Tucker left detective Borges's the crime scene.
and Timothy Spencer left part of himself at the crime scene.
but his name would never have come of it wasn't for detective organs.
all.
all.
all.
