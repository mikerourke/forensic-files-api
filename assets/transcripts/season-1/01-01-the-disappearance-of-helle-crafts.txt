Awful weather out there, do you want to go inside the diner?
No, I don't want anyone to see me like this.
You're not going to like these.
It's what you thought.
On a dark and rainy day in the fall of 1986 Helle Crafts learned from a private investigator that her husband was having an affair.
Is that your husband?
Yes, that's Richard.
Shortly after this, Helle Crafts disappeared. This is the story of how forensic science solved the puzzle.
I first met Helle Crafts in the fall of 1986, she came in to see me and was discussing the possibility of a divorce from her husband. She was very concerned about what was happening at that time. She was also concerned about potential violence shall we say.
By all accounts, 39 year old Helle Crafts was a caring mother of three young children in an unhappy marriage.
She strongly suspected the affair, she felt she knew who the individual was, but she really wanted some confirmation. So, we talked about hiring a detective to prove that in fact, yes, he was involved with another woman at that time.
It was a typical scenario of husbands never home, constantly lying about his whereabouts and she'd had enough.
When Helle Crafts hired detective Keith Mayo, she provided an important lead: a long distance number she saw on the phone bills that she didn't recognize.
I met with her several days after we had caught Richard with his girlfriend and there were many photos of affection between the two, her kissing him and holding his hand, rubbing his back, those types of photos.
She just broke down, she cried for at least five or ten minutes, just sobbing.
Helle and Richard Crafts had been married for twelve years. They both worked for the airlines, Helle as a flight attendant for Pan Am, Richard a pilot for Eastern Airlines. He was also a part time policeman.
I'd describe him as very cold, you know when he looked at you he had a very cold stare.
Their relationship was not a close one, and friends say Richard sometimes hit Helle.
Dearest mother, here I am again, in London. I said to Richard, I want to be divorced. I no longer trust in Richard.
After Helle filed for divorce she confided in friends on her flight crew. I want to tell you something I told my lawyer if anything ever happens to me, don't think it was an accident and that's an unusual comment to get from a client.
On November 18th, 1986, Helle returned from a European flight assignment and was dropped off at home by her best friend. It was the last time anyone saw her.
A few days later, Helle missed next flight assignment. She didn't call in, so friends called the Crafts home.
Richard said she went to Denmark to visit her sick mother. Later he told a different story, that Helle was on vacation with a friend.
All which proved not to be true and when this all came together one started talking to the next to the next there was a collective sense of panic, in short time.
The friends were basically telling me that she had disappeared and that she was not the type of individual who would do this. She had three small children, so I called Keith Mayo.
I immediately told Diane that I thought we should go over to the New Town Police Department to report her missing and they just turned a deaf ear on us.
So Mayo launched his own investigation. In this home video, the Crafts live in nanny talks about some mysterious dark stain she noticed on the carpet shortly after Helle disappeared.
On the inside of the bedroom door, there was a spot? A black spot?
Yeah
How big would you say it was?
About this big.
Did it look like a stain?
It looked like a stain, but it hadn’t been there before.
The fact that there was new carpet in the master bedroom and Richard ripped up the carpet and wouldn't give the nanny an explanation as to why.
Also suspicious, a large freezer missing from the garage and credit card receipts showed that Richard had rented a commercial woodchipper right after Helle disappeared. Had something happened to Helle inside the house, and was her husband involved? Police asked Richard Crafts to take a lie detector test.
Did you kill your wife?
No.
Do you know your wife's whereabouts?
No.
Did you have anyone kill your wife?
No.
He showed very little reaction at all. There was nothing that either my partner saw or
I saw that indicated he was lying.
 With Helle Crafts still missing and no leads, Connecticut state police called in their secret weapon: forensic expert Dr Henry Lee.
Dr Henry Lee is the director of the Connecticut State Police Forensics Laboratory and one of the world's most respected forensic experts. He accompanied police as they searched the Crafts home.
We started examining some piece of physical evidence and found some tiny clues.
On the mattress, Dr Lee discovered five tiny stains, so small they could barely be seen.
Could they hold the key to the disappearance of Helle Crafts? An orthotolidine solution on the mattress fibers turned blue, it was blood. A species test proved it was human blood, but was it Helles?
An antigen test revealed type O positive, the same type as Helle Crafts, and microscopic analysis revealed it was circulation blood and not menstrual.
If its circulation blood, now which means injured to create such a pattern.
Dr Lee studied the angle and intensity of the blood’s impact. He concluded the blood hit the mattress at an angle of ten degrees, meaning it came from an individual leaning over the bed or kneeling.
The blood was moving through the air at medium velocity, consistent with an injury caused by a blunt object. And there was a six inch blood smear on the side of the mattress. The bathroom towels had been washed recently, but Dr Lee tested them with an orthotolidine solution. The blue areas proved the towels had been soaked with blood.
The next issue of course, a human body cannot just vanish in the air. The body has to be someplace.
But there was no body, no weapon, and no witnesses. Police needed more to go on. So they looked for any unusual events that might somehow be connected to Helle Crafts disappearance. It led to an important break. It snowed the week of Helen's disappearance.
A snowplow driver reported seeing a wood chipper on a bridge about 3:30 in the morning. A man briefly appeared wearing an orange poncho.
He saw the same wood chipper again on River Road about an hour later.
I said well take this man to the location, to the exact location where he saw the wood chipper. It was here where the Housatonic River runs into Lake Zoar, police searched the river bank.
All they found were a few mounds of wood chips. But when they took a closer look, they found a piece of an envelope. It was mail, addressed to miss Helle L. Crafts.
They were just laying there, and I thought, good lord you know. I didn't even think too much about how the chipper came into play at that point until we started finding a lot of a lot of hair. That was when I remarked to my boss, you know, I said you know if he did what I think he did, it's time for me to retire.
Police spent days sifting through the dirt and debris along the river bank. In addition to the letter and blond hair, they also discovered a few blue fibers, a great piece of metal, what looked to be some tiny bone fragments, and another piece of evidence which just appeared.
The sun had melted the snow away from this wall, and right against the wall laying right on top of the leaves was a painted fingernail.
Divers explored the bottom of the river, and found pieces of a chain saw. Even more unusual, the serial number had been scratched off.
Everything was taken to the State Police Forensic Laboratory in Meriden, Connecticut because any investigation involves so many specialty area, that's when we start calling forensic team.
By now the story was front page news around the world. Richard Craft was a suspect, but he maintained his innocence, saying he didn't kill his wife, didn't know her whereabouts, and that he had passed a lie detector test.
But the forensics might tell a different story.
When Dr Lee convened the first meeting of his forensic team, he knew they faced a difficult task.
T hey need either that piece of paper from me that says somebody's dead, or occasionally a huge pile of evidence to convince them.
To identify the individual become a scientific challenge.
They began by examining every notch of the chain saw, and found some human hair, tissue, and a minute piece of fiber.
In size it was barely visible with the naked eye on the cutting edge of the chain.
The fiber was a bluish green cotton, the same color as Helle’s favorite cotton nightshirt, and it matched other blue fibers found in the river. But since the serial number was scratched away, it was impossible to tell who owned the chain saw, or was it? By using a particular chemical solution that will eat away the upper layers of the metal that have been altered by the water or by some physical attempts to alter the serial number.
It worked, the serial number on the chain saw 5921616, it matched the warranty card sent in by Richard B. Crafts.
Next, forensic experts wanted to find out whose hair was on the chainsaw and at the river every one of the 2,666 hairs was examined under a microscope. A lot of the hairs had been cut, but not cut with scissors.
Did it belong to Helle Crafts?
So we have to find some known hair to compare. Basically we use her hairbrush.
There was a characteristic that is somewhat unusual for head hair and that's a ridge that was present in the head hairs.
They concluded that the hairs found on the chain saw and at the river were microscopically similar to the hair from Helles hairbrush. Next, they turned their attention to the finger nails with the bright red nail polish.
A chemist compared it to a bottle of Helle’s fingernail polish found in her home, analyzing the various organic compounds.
These graphs show that the polish on the fingernail found at the river is the same as polish taken from the bottle found on Helle's nightstand.
Good forensic work determined that the fingernail polish and the hair were both similar to Helle's, but they couldn't prove she was dead.
I received a phone call from Dr Lee asking me if I would come and take a look at the these little pieces of what he thought to be a bone, and wanted me to to see if I could identify them in any way.
Dr Lee suspected that the bones found at the river had gone through the wood chipper craft had rented, so Dr Lee got the same machine and ran a test.
This is actual footage. A pig was put through the chipper, since their skin and bones are similar to humans.
Dr Lee noticed that the chipper produced a unique signature type of cut, one that match the cutting pattern on the debris found at the river.
What I was presented with were these very very tiny, literally millimeter size fragments of bone, and in amongst some of these fragments it was possible to see that some of the fragments indeed came from a human.
Under a spectrograph, Dr Harper noticed tiny grooves in the bones. The grooves told a story.
They were formed by blood vessels inside the top of the skull. Something only humans have.
They also identified skull fragments from the side of the head, and these were the most important from a forensic point of view.
So the fractious beveling outwards, the force came from the inside. It was a whole lot of force, so we don't know if that's what killed her.
We're not sure if she was dead before that, but we certainly knew she was dead afterwards.
So now we know a human being is dead. The next question is who?
Dr Harper froze some of the bone fragments with liquid nitrogen, then ground them into a fine powder.
Tests revealed the bones came from an individual with type O Positive blood, Helle Crafts blood type.
Finally, Dr Lee turned his attention to the great piece of metal believed to be a crown to a tooth.
But there was no human remains on that crown, so that couldn't be used as a form of identification.
They needed more, so Dr Lee asked Dr Carazoulas himself to go to the river, where he searched for five days.
Then, a break.
I'd been at the crime scene for maybe eight hours, I slipped and fell into the brook, and I had a pail and I was picking evidence up.
I clean my hand off in this pail that I was collecting evidence in, and when I came into the tent, I put all the contents of the pail down I wash my hand. I looked down and there was the tooth.
But was it Helle Crafts? I was able to match all the years of different X rays.
I imagine it was from 1986 back to 1982, so I have no doubt in my mind that the tooth I found came from Helle Crafts mouth.
Finally, the forensic team had an actual match and they say Helle Crafts teeth are in this pile, and they were knocked out of her head violently.
And we have a human head going through violently into the same house, so we said that means Helle Crafts is dead, period.
Based on the forensic evidence, Richard Crafts was arrested and charged with the murder of his wife.
What happened to Helle Crafts? Based on the forensic evidence, a reasonable scenario can be pieced together.
Thanks for the ride.
On November 18th Helle Crafts returned from a flight to Germany around 7:00pm.
She put the children to bed around 8:00. The nanny had the night off and wasn't expected home until midnight.
Before going to bed, Helle changed into our favorite blue night shirt, looked through her mail, stuffed it into her pocket, and began changing her sheets.
Then, it happened quickly.
Using a police flashlight, the first blow knocked her to the ground, the second produced a blood splatter, hitting the mattress at a ten degree angle.
While falling, her head grazed the side of the mattress, leading the blood smear.
He wrapped the body in the bed covers, carried her through the house into the garage and placed the body into a freezer.
Richard tried to clean up the blood with some towels which were later washed.
But traces of blood remained on the towels, later discovered by Dr Lee. Marie Thomas, the nanny, arrived home around 2:00am and went right to bed.
At daybreak Crafts took the children and the nanny to his sister's house, saying their mother had left early.
He then rented the largest commercial wood chipper he could find and a U Haul truck, using his credit card.
By night time, Helle's body was completely frozen. Crafts transported the remains, along with a chain saw and some wood to the river.
The snow plow driver spotted the wood chipper on the bridge around 3:30 in the morning, and again near the river an hour later.
Using his chainsaw, Crafts dismembered Helle frozen body, and put the pieces through the chipper, along with some wood.
Since the body was frozen, it produced little if any blood splatter. Most of the debris blew into the river, only a few pieces fell short landing on the bank.
The mail Helle placed in her night shirt pocket passed through the chipper virtually untouched.
Before leaving, Crafts took apart the chainsaw, scratched the serial number off, and threw the pieces into the river.
How close was the brutal murder of Helle Crafts to the perfect crime?
Boy, damn close, damn close. And if that person truly believes they're not going to be caught there's no fear or threat to them, they could get by a polygraph test.
The key to solving this case so called teamwork. We assembled a good team and work together.
Amazing that the human body writes so much of its history in itself.
