all the newspapers and we would insist that they keep it alive on the fifth anniversary of sixth anniversary the fifteenth anniversary we capitalized then detectives had an idea tonight.
Erica's most wanted the television show America's most wanted has led to the capture of some of the F. B. I.'s most celebrated fugitives by generating phone tips from viewers one night watching TV we watched America's most wanted and I thought this might be a very interesting case and on the take on if we were successful in getting the the worst case aired someone out there would recognize him and would make that telephone call detectives convinced America's most wanted to do an episode on the John list mergers despite the fact that the case was almost two decades old I said this is a guy I'd like to see caught and we decided to do a journalist but there was a problem.
the end of each episode viewers see a photograph of the wanted person the most recent photo of John list had been taken years before the murders.
what would he look.
twenty years later the journalist murder case would now enter the highly specialized world of forensic sculpting I had been involved in the battle for missing children's rights for years since the murder my son in nineteen eighty one and I had come across Frank Bender over the years as a renowned forensic reconstruction artist forensic sculptor Frank Bender reconstructs faces to help police track down aging fugitives or identify decomposed bodies part art part science part intuition this is the scope of an unidentified individual police found in the field to make an identification they would need to see her face I work with physical anthropologist I work with that odontology just friends of Dennis in other words I.
%HESITATION path ology this detective who's when going from skull to face Bender refers to special charts that measure facial tissue thickness based on race age and gender using these measurements as guidelines Bender calculates the proper thickness of the skin in order to mold the shape of the face with this clay more important in the facial tissue thickness is paying attention to the forms in the sky all the nuances the differences the asymmetry.
what makes this call different from the others and they're all different Bender then makes a fiberglass bust from the mold on the right benders forensic bust of the skull found in the field on the left is a photograph of a teenage girl who had been missing and was then identified from Frank benders buster Bender's extraordinary talent to put faces on the dance.
but now the applied to the living and aging mass murder America's most wanted ask Frank.
eighteen years face John.
stage was now set to pump new life into an old murder case.
this is John list in nineteen seventy one Frank benders job was to figure out what he would look like eighteen years later all he had to work with with some old photographs computers can age your face but benders old fashioned hands on technique gives the forensic bust a personal touch a lot of these computers nowadays we'll just add like five wrinkles because R. eight years older well sometimes you could actually look better after a few years if you had to carry yourself to look at John list the individual Bender needed a psychological profile of the killer I get into the head of the person in the sense I want to become that person while I'm working on the fugitive I wanna feel like that person I want to know everything about that person he called on the help of forensic psychologist Richard Walter together sculptor and psychologist would predict how John list would H. Bender and water poured over newspaper articles and photographs to analyze the man behind the murders they researched his strict upbringing by German parents.
the lord is my shepherd I shall not the Lutheran church had been the focus of young John's life he was an only child and the son of an overly protective domineering mother list had a master's degree in accounting but lacked social skills and had a history of losing jobs the psychological profile revealed a man who killed out of anger and retaliation because of his own failure the perpetrator has a history of frustration and feeling entrapped by women generally women of their own age group are older are women in the three RD the psychological profile helped reinforce Bender's vision of the aging fugitive I had his mouth going down on the corners because of anxiety that I felt he carried with him from committing these crimes and Richard brought out that it wasn't guilt from killing his family.
but the anxiety and the fear of being caught Bender also took into account genetics he looked at photographs of John lists parents and added sagging jowls and a receding hairline to the blast list had a surgical scar behind his right ear and Bender researched how the scar would look as he aged.
with the fiberglass busts complete Bender painted the skin and hair and put the list in a suit and tie what he and Walter thought list would where most of the time but the bus wasn't complete the final touch would be a pair of glasses Walter was certain list wasn't vain enough to wear contact lenses and Bender predicted list would be wearing a different style of glasses than those he wore at age forty six Bender was convinced list would want to hide the fact that he was a failure by wearing glasses with dark thick frames to look more intelligent more important than he really was and this was through the help of Richard Walters profile Bender look through dozens of pairs of use glasses and found the perfect pair to use the bus painted face with the down turn.
sagging jowls receding hairline and aging scar now looked out from behind dark thick frame.
a forensic bust was complete tonight on America's most wanted.
how can I.
all this we've ever pursued on America's most wanted.
on Sunday night may twenty first nineteen eighty nine America's most wanted airs right after so dollar on the list murder I'm just saying.
note in Denver Colorado.
recognize the face.
the mass murder.
if you know anything about John last call the night America's most wanted revealed the forensic boss John last won the Flannery and her daughter were watching from their home in Denver Colorado.
much to their home they saw a striking resemblance between John list and a former neighbor and it just all started adding up gradually.
that he was an accountant and a Lutheran and that he had a scar behind his ear and that he was well put together and classy dresser and.
by the time they got to the sculpture.
I was convinced it was him to look at it you would have.
no.
and the clincher for me was the classes and the gels reset home thank god that that's Bob Bob Clark Bob is John list.
we've got to we've got to call wonder Flannery told the FBI that her former neighbor recently moved to Richmond Virginia and was using the name Bob Clark the F. B. I. close Dan and agents arrested Robert Peter Clarke at the accounting office where he worked in Richmond I approached him and I asked him I said are you Mr Clark and he said yes and then I said are you John list.
and he says no I'm Robert Pete Clark but Bobby discard behind his right ear and a fingerprint check match prints on the gun permit application John list had filled out one month before the murders.
Bob Clark and John list with the same man.
I said they guarantee that was it thank god he was amazing John list wore the same style glasses the Frank Bender had used on the forensic bust Frank Bender it was one hundred percent right the picture of John list when he was captured was put next to the picture of that bust on the front page of The New York Times John list had the same exact Blass's on that Frank Bender had put on the forensic bust it was on candy was almost as though the person who did the bust had actually been looking at John Lewis twenty did hi John lists trial the story unfolding of how the mild mannered church going accountant meticulously planned the brutal execution of his entire family listed lost his job buckling under the strain of mounting bills and the perceived moral decay of his family John list made a decision you decide you want to do this this was the only way out this was a way for him to start with a clean slate and that's why he did it.
after the children left for school.
John let's put his plan in motion.
he shot his wife in the head at point blank range.
he then climbed two flights of stairs and entered his mother's apartment.
he left his mother's body upstairs.
but placed his wife's body on a sleeping bag and drag it to the ballroom.
even cleaned up the blood.
later that afternoon as the children arrived home he murdered each one.
the oldest boy John put up a struggle.
Beijing fired ten times.
he dragged the children's bodies to the ballroom lined them up on sleeping bags next to their mother and cleaned up more black.
the list family more.
was now complete.
with the executions over list said a prayer.
then wrote the letter to his pastor confessing to the murders.
he lowered the thermostat to slow the body's decomposition turned on the radio to a classical music station and began his life as a fugitive.
before the bodies were even discovered list made his way to Denver Clyde for new social security number as Robert.
in time he made friends with his neighbor Wanda Flannery rejoined the Lutheran church and married one this friend Delores Miller his new wife never suspected a thing this told her his first wife died of cancer and that he had no children I do not believe it I I love my husband very deeply I do not believe this is the same man the couple eventually moved back east to the Richmond Virginia area where list found an accounting job Richard Walters psychological profile accurately predicted almost every aspect of John lists flight from justice what was he doing when they caught him he was a CPA he was still a volunteer in the Lutheran church of god the kills his own mother killed his own wife and three kids is still volunteering and Lutheran church still the same creature that was killed.
for nearly twenty years after the brutal murder of his entire family.
a jury found John list guilty of five counts of first degree murder.
and sentenced him to life in prison John in the list will be eternally synonymous with concepts of selfishness horror indeed he is a man who could clearly calculating the and cunningly conceive and carry out currently planned to assassinate each of his three children.
I was just thrilled that the merger then between psychology and sculpture worked it was an invaluable tool in making a determination of how the guy would probably look and it was it was just on candy as to how close the sculpture was to the actual man I really paid attention to I think as much information as I had about John listen what he was told what he was about I truly believe it wasn't for Frank Bender journalists would still be at large.
we finally brought journalists to justice.
