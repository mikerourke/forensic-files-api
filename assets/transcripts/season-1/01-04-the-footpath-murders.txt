On a deserted port path early on the morning of November 22nd, 1983, a hospital worker witnessed a terrible sight.
The first case in the world where DNA evidence help find the killer.
Narborough England a quiet little village of about 6000 residents where violent crime is almost unheard of.
That it is something you expect to happen in a city not in a small village community.
Fifteen year old Linda Mann was a typical teenager quiet but popular she liked school and enjoyed being with friends.
On a cold November evening that left her home in our power to walk a mile or so to our friends house.
When Linda didn't return home by midnight frantic parents called the police.
Early the next morning.
For semi nude body was discovered along the secluded footpath known locally as the black pad.
Detective David Baker was called to the scene.
Clothing was on the site the right jeans removed and are on the clothes were strewn about.
It was a cold night and she's gonna around the neck none none this cough avenues to strangle.
She was very brutally attacked sexually assaulted where to blend as murder traveled quickly in the otherwise quiet village the people were horrified horrified.
I'm very worried particulars with the young girls in daughters.
A search of the crime scene turned up little of substance but the autopsy provided some important clues about men demands last moments alive.
The absence all injury to private parts and also gently on the body.
There was very little injury to her would suggest that he was not a violent attack on but she may have died very quickly.
The conclusion was she was strangled and then right.
A semen sample taken from Linda's body turned out to be an extremely important piece of evidence.
It came from an individual with type a blood and the PGM one plus enzyme profile but this match ten percent of the adult male population in England.
Since Linda Mann's body was found only a few hundred yards from the local psychiatric hospital some speculated that the killer may have been a patient.
Others weren't social missing those engines to establish is that it was unlikely to be in a psychiatric patient from the hospital.
Is much more likely to be a man leading a normal life.
Perhaps within a family certainly one who had friends relatives and contacts who sort of him as a normal individual.
When the man was in the wrong place at the wrong time former cop turned author Joseph Wambaugh wrote a bestselling book entitled the bloody.
It chronicles the events surrounding the murder of Linda Mann and the history making investigation which would follow.
It's very unusual and still is in a village like Narborough in Britain.
For a complete stranger to ambush and murder someone on a footpath.
I mean someone heard police questioned thousands of people around the man's whereabouts on the night she was killed.
They put more into a murder investigation over there which they calling enquiring.
And then we do here because they have so few murders compared to us.
While police investigated every lead, fear held villagers hostage.
Thank you lady should be very scared because we haven't found him so we don't really know what's happening at school.
Yes of my next point to give him a bottle of now whenever minimized well anytime really.
Linda Mann was buried in the church are not far from where she was murdered.
On the day of her funeral police set up the surveillance and video tape the crowd for anything or anyone unusual.
Often one for ones that criminals will revisit the scene of the crime or some other activity associated with the crime and it was just a precaution.
Today police issued a new poster to try to jog people's memories that was little help.
The investigation dragged on for months and the years.
With no eye witnesses strong leads and several false trails the murder went cold.
Well really in any police investigation after a week or two the trails usually cold it's quite difficult we shop protons.
Yes please come forward with all along Linda's parents held out hope that the killer of their daughter would be caught.
The only thing they could possibly get now was justice for their daughter and that seemed to be going away from them.
It's always frustrating when you know you're not going to answer to a problem on the menu forever looking over your shoulder.
I hate to see what you've missed and then trying to guess what might happen in the future.
Search for Linda Mann's killer for the next three years.
Three years had passed since the murder of Linda Mann and life in the small village of Narborough was beginning to return to normal.
Until the afternoon of July 31st, 1986, another fifteen year old school girl, Dawn Ashworth was walking home from a part time job at a news van.
Instead of taking the main road she took a short cut down the overgrown foot back called Ten Pound Lane.
When she wasn't home by 9:30 that night, parents called the police.
Another girl with miss Dawn Ashworth went missing last night.
And then in the month yeah.
Two days later, police discovered Dawn Ashworth's nude body under some heavy brush and hay.
She was discovered less than a mile from where and when Linda Mann was murdered three years earlier.
Like Linda Mann, Dawn Ashworth and strangled and sexually assaulted.
Dawn had quite mocked injuries to gender letter which would indicate was about a violent attack.
Ranges elsewhere in the body would also indicate that she had suffered five digit FO should be detect violently which would indicate that she had put up for a struggle before she died.
Semen samples taken during Dawn's autopsy revealed that the attacker had the same blood type as Linda Mann's murderer.
There were other similarities as well.
There were signature elements in the crime certainly both murders took place on foot paths.
Both girls were around teenagers both girls were walking alone Bussmann the strangled.
Both survey late sexually assaulted both came from the same locality.
They were both found in similar circumstances and both girls attended the same school.
After the second murder fear really took over the main fit essentially grabbed him by the throat and squeeze the life out of them two young girls are being killed.
Family didn't't know who was going to be next.
All school girls were advised to travel in groups and not to walk anywhere alone.
Dawn Ashworth's father had given his daughter the same advice.
I warned and warned about the dangers of going down there on the road we've got to find.
Three free trade is that did this to my door to try to overturn stop it from happening again.
Police launched an extensive investigation into the murder of Dawn Ashworth and within a week police got a break.
Witnesses saw a young man in the vicinity of Ten Pound Lane on the afternoon of Dawn Ashworth today.
He was seventeen year old Richard, a kitchen worker at the psychiatric hospital located just a few hundred yards from where both Linda Mann and Dawn Ashworth had been murdered.
Police brought him in for questioning and they quickly became their prime suspect.
For one thing he knew details of the murder which weren't in the newspapers.
In addition to that one way to question Richard Buckland he couldn't really account for his movements on that particular afternoon.
If I were working on the case I probably would have become very suspicious given the things he told the police given his background given his reputation around the village for liking to scare girls are walking home from school things like that.
Finally after fifteen hours of interrogation Richard Buckland confessed to the rape and murder direct on national.
Police finally had their man.
Given the similarities between the two murders police were convinced that Buckland also raped and murdered Linda Mann three years earlier
Buckland denied it.
Was he telling the truth?
The answer lay just a few miles away in a university laboratory.
Richard Buckland confessed to killing Dawn Ashworth but insisted he had nothing to do with the murder of Linda Mann three years earlier.
Police were convinced he was lying and set out to find the truth.
Here at the University of Leicester, ironically less than ten miles away from where both teenagers were murdered, doctor Alec Jeffries, a geneticist had been researching hereditary diseases when he accidentally discovered an amazing technique called DNA or genetic profiling.
This is a case of eureka.
You could see individual identification, you could see parentage analysis paternity, dispute immigration cases.
David Baker said, well look let's cement the case against this young man.
Let's go to this geneticist at Leicester University, this doctor Alec Jeffries, and take the semen samples from both murders and cement our case with his new thing called genetic fingerprinting whatever it is.
Let's just prove that he did both of them because we know we must have done both.
Dr Jeffries wasn't sure that he could do what Baker wanted because this sort of analysis had never been done before.
Dr Jeffries breakthrough technique for analyzing DNA is called restriction fragment length polymorphism, RFLP.
It can identify an individual based on just a small amount of their DNA.
DNA that can come from semen, blood, hair roots, and other cells.
DNA is a complex chemical which is present in all living cells.
It's a little like the computer program containing coded instructions on how to make a human being.
No two individuals have the same DNA except for identical twins.
Dr Jeffries task was to take the semen recovered from Linda Mann and Dawn Ashworth and compare it to the blood sample from Richard Buckland to see if it was a match.
First, white blood cells from Richard Buckland's blood sample were treated with a special chemical solution that allows the DNA a sticky white substance to float free.
Next, the DNA is cut into smaller pieces using special proteins called restriction enzyme, like chemical scissors, the DNA fragments must then be sorted out by a process called electrophoresis.
The DNA is marked with the radioactive dye and placed in separate lanes on electrophoretic gel then get subjected to an electric field violet light.
To see how the electrical current draws the negatively charged fragments through the gel the positive band of the tray.
Separated fragments are them visualized on x-ray film called an auto-radiogram, which resembles a barcode showing an individual's unique genetic make.
Doctor Jeffries first use this technique to resolve an immigration case and after that a paternity dispute this would be the first time ever attempted in a criminal case to reveal the identity of a double murder.
Let's start with the then the man this is her DNA profile taken from a half next track is a mixture of semen vaginal fluid from that victim showing her DNA profile is expected plus a single man semen DNA profile.
Next victim door national of this is a blood DNA profile of bands here and another one off to the left.
Trace amounts of semen recovered from that victim both revealed to faint bands.
Whose position on the auto-radiogram is very similar to the semen profile scene from Linda Mann so first conclusion both girls are being raped in the mud to by the same man.
What about the prime suspect Richard Buckland this is his blood DNA profile here and here.
Take the different from semen profile inclusion.
Both girls being raped the leftovers in the mud to by the same man and that man was not the prime suspect Richard Buckland.
The result shocked the police.
It was it was a blow to us.
They didn't basically believe what we're saying and that was quite right healthy skepticism of of a thin taunting you technology and indeed arguably the results myself.
So we did re testing the testing was done the game independently by home office friends it sought to school pointing to the same conclusion.
Namely the box and was not the guilty policy in this case after four months in custody Richard Buckland was released and became the first person in the world to be exonerated of murder through the use of DNA profiling.
I have no doubt whatsoever they will be found guilty how to not be if they did have the same in jail for life.
I mean that was that was remarkable the cards but why did Richard Buckland confessed to a crime now that didn't commit.
I should start getting ready that you still have a chance he had to have discovered the body himself because in the terms of his confession he was able to give a very detailed description of her clothing where the body was in what position, turns on details of nudity could possibly know the state actually seen the ball day.
With Buckland now out, a double murderer was still loose.
And of course the next stage was to David bacon than to make what I think was an incredibly courageous decision.
On DNA man hunt.
Police sent letters to all men between the ages of thirteen and thirty three living in the villages of narrow and and.
The letter asked each man to volunteer for a blood and saliva test some have called it a genetic dragnet.
It is voluntary and we are, you know, appealing to the people to come forward.
I'm sure they expected that the real killer.
If he was indeed a resident of the village, he would probably try to escape responsibility of giving a blood sample.
DNA testing would only be performed on those who have the same blood type as the killer, which was about ten percent.
It was really a attempt to try and flush out the guilty party which is what the way.
The trap was now set on DNA manhunt to flush out the killer of Linda Mann and Dawn Ashworth.
It was a bold plan.
More than 5,000 men voluntarily gave blood and saliva samples with one worker with this little bakery.
His name was Colin Pitchfork and was already known to police for earlier convictions for indecent exposure.
He didn't want any further involvement with the police so he persuaded coworkers Ian Kelly take the blood tests for.
Kelly live outside the area and wasn't asked to take the test himself, Kelly was the perfect foil.
Which will spend the money on that he'd already given blood on behalf of somebody else who couldn't go because she was wanted by the police.
Eccentric Sentra and Kelly ostensibly swelled up will go on in Cinco since police required identification before taking a blood sample Kelly needed some photographic proof he was Colin Pitchfork.
They both went down to a photo booth and took a passport size photo of Ian cal.
Pitchfork took its own passport slip the plastic casing with the razor blade and neatly inserted Kelly's photo in its place.
The police failed to observe the photograph been substituted for the original one and therefore they believed that this was Colin Pitchfork and that was his picture to prove it.
Kelly then took the blood test for Colin Pitchfork of the more than 5,000 man who voluntarily gave blood and saliva samples none match the profile of the merger.
But no one could anticipate what would happen next.
On a summer's evening one year after Dawn Ashworth was found brutally raped and murdered Ian Kelly joined fellow bakery workers local.
Conversation turned to the DNA man.
I over heard Kelly bragging that he had taken the blood test for Colin Pitchfork.
She sat there and listened to that and thought to yourself there's something not right about this.
This isn't something someone normally does no matter how afraid he is of the police.
And so she put in a call to the Leicestershire.
Other inquire you team and that's what made them focus on Colin Pitchfork.
Police quickly located Pitchfork to question him about the blood test and what he might know about the two murders.
Within a very short time he confessed to killing both Linda Mann and Dawn Ashworth.
Pitchfork believed in DNA fingerprinting right away not that he know anymore about it than the rest of the world but he'd been following it in the newspapers and he believed in it.
And he knew that it was as good as a fingerprint and he knew he was finished.
When they arrested him, he confessed quite readily.
Without this breakthrough the chances of pleased that would have never cool which will and I think it's fairly clear that how did not being cooled down he would have killed and killed and killed again.
Colin Pitchfork was twenty seven years old married with two children.
His wife had no idea she was married to a serial killer.
He was able to see perfectly well so that's nobody in the whole world news he was the guilty person.
The same story the wife the brother the mother the friends of serial killers never suspect that they could be serial killers.
Colin Pitchfork was the last man to take a blood test in the investigation of the man Ashworth murders.
The DNA typing showed to no one's surprise Pitchfork was a perfect match.
They took the panel filled page full competitive with semen recover from the victims I showed that the these complex Patton's might stop.
On January 22nd, 1988, Colin Pitchfork was the first person ever to be convicted in the murder case solved by DNA profiling and was sentenced to life in prison.
For his part in the deception Ian Kelly was convicted of conspiracy to pervert justice and sentenced to an 18 month prison sentence which wants to spend no time.
I was wrong for doing what I did.
I think we've learned a lot that's both of these to go.
Scientific advances they made with DNA spread itself now throw out to the world.
It was this case will cases where all which DNA ready cut it's teeth.
In the forensic sense, the door has been opened to a whole new aspect of the medical investigation.
People will be talking about this case a hundred years from now not because of my book but because of the al Jeffries subscribers.
